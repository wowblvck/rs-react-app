> EN: This application was developed as part of the training at the RS School, the purpose of which was to learn how to work with the React JS library, from the very basics (components) to rendering the page on the server side. The application is divided into separate branches according to the order of studying the modules of the school. The latest react-ssr branch contains completed changes. The design of the application was developed from scratch according to the requirements of the school assignment. The server part (API) was also developed independently using JSON-server and is located in a hidden repository. In addition to the basic requirements of the school, adaptive layout was implemented, sending the form to the server.
